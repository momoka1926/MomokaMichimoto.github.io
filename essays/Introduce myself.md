Hi, my name is Momomoka Michimoto.  I was born and raised in Kanagawa prefecture in Japan.  Kanagawa prefecture is located just under Tokyo and is famous for Yokohama, Kamakura, and Enoshima. 
I have an older sister.  She graduated from UH last semester and now she is studying master's. 
I came to Hawaii three years ago and entered Kapiolani Community College. 
I majored in Liberal Arts, and I finally entered the University of Hawaii at Manoa this semester.  At UH, I'm currently majoring in MIS Business major.
This is my very first semester at UH, so I'm kind of nervous.  My overall goals for this semester are to get used to this new environment and not to be afraid of speaking English.  
Not being afraid of speaking English is my most crucial goal during studying abroad.     
I'm a beginner at programing things.  I wish I would find how technologies are fun while I'm studying with everyone.
