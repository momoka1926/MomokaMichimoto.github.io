The first thing I did to start WODs was to watch “Getting Started with WODs.” After I made sure what I had to work on, I carefully read through each project’s instructions. If I found unsure things while reading it, I searched it on Google and wrote it down on paper so that I can read it back while I worked on the BrowserHistory.  
 
For the BrowserHistory1, I could finish it in Sd time.  I didn’t do it twice because my goal was to complete the project within DNF time.  As I said, I wrote unsure things down on paper in the first place, and I did not get stuck so much on this project.  It just took a little longer than I expected, but I felt satisfied.
For the BrowserHistory2, I got a little stuck, so I did it twice.  I spent DNF time on the first attempt because the font did not reflect on the page even though I think I correctly typed the code. I watched the instruction of the video for BrowserHistory2 after the first attempt and tried to confirm what the wrong was by watching it, but still, I didn’t find what the problem was.  So I examined on Google what I had to add to make the font change reflected on the page, and I found out the way.  After I understood the issue, I deleted the first project and tried it again.  As a result, I completed it in Rx time, which I was happy to achieve.            

I struggled most with BrowserHistory3.  I had no clue how to start it from just reading the instructions, so I watched the solution video first to get tips and tried my first attempt.  However, I got stuck in the process of making the list horizontal style bar, so DNF time passed.  I deleted my first attempt and reviewed it, and compared it to the solution.  In my second attempt, I managed to complete it within Sd time but I got a little stuck in the same process which I struggled with in the first attempt.  So, I decided to try a third attempt, and I finally completed it within Rx time.  

My advice is to write your unsure things down on paper first and read the instructions carefully.  I said it many times, but if you wrote it unclear on paper, you can review it even after the time when you want to know, such as when working on another project.  The other advice I want to say but I also learned from the solution video is to use copy and paste.  Copy and paste help you from mistyping and also not wasting your time typing the same thing over and over again.  Furthermore, I didn’t learn just how useful copy and paste is but also learned how HTML and CSS connect each other.  I thought coding was similar to a puzzle throughout WODs projects. We don’t need to be in a rush while working on WODs projects but need completely valid code to make changes.
