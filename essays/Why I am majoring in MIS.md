  - Why I am majoring in MIS

Hi, my name is Momoka Michimoto.  I'm an international student majoring in B.A. in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawaii.  
I was originally planning to major in Travel Industry Management, but I thought due to COVID-19 that it's probably not a stable job.  So, I decided to major in Business.  The reason why I decided to major in MIS is I believe technologies are rapidly developing and I found it looks interesting to ride on its wave.  Furthermore, I noticed throughout  this pandemic how the world needs technologies.
