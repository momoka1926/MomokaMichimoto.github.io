**1. Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. Here is an example PPT prototype**
This is the link that shows how each page will look like: 
This is the link to my brief explanation video about my web page: https://youtu.be/G4cT9_qnFPw
**2. Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.**
I’m thinking that the shopping cart will be on separate pages. The shopping cart will display the quantity that customers selected in the shopping cart and ask them to purchase or keep shopping for each product.
**3. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.**
I will use sessions to manage my shopping cart by expiring each session after 10 minutes.  Also, using sessions to carry over the quantities of the products that the customers entered on the order page, so their quantities selected will be kept.  I have yet to create the code for sessions but this is the overall plan of my website.
**4. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?**
To avoid access to my application, the users have to have their own session id, so they are only able to access the cart unless they logged in or registered for my store.  The particular security concerts I must address is if they get access to the cart even if they did not log in or register.  
**5. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary).**
Upon a successful login, I will send a message to the user, like “(this going to be username) thank you for your order :)"
**6. If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible?**
I am working on an assignment by myself.
**7. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?**
I am approaching assignment 3 differently than assignment 2. I am trying to start work on it earlier than assignment2 so I would not be in a rush later.
